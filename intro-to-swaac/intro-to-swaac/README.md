> My devblog takes another turn. How will this one turn out?

Over the years, I've been keeping notes and writing things down about stuff I've learned, stuff I want to share, and so on. In the never-ending quest to learn new things, I've also re-organized and repurposed this collection so many times.

A caveat: this collection of notes is largely personal learning; it is by no means authoritative, canonical, complete, or even necessarily accurate. These are notes that represent the best of my understanding and my own understanding at the time I captured them. If you find something wrong, confusing, or want to ask a question, leave a comment, please!
