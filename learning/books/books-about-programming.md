## [**Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13590009-think-like-a-programmer) by V. Anton Spraul. ##

Spraul's purpose in this book is not to teach you how to write a program, but to begin to understand the problem-solving approach that is inherent in good programmers. Like so many skills, programming is driven by the desire and vision of the practitioner. A painter uses brushes, canvas, paints, other media to create a work of art, but it isn't the tools, it isn't the specific techniques, and it isn't even the particular skill the painter has that makes a good work of art; it is their composition, the melding of media and surface, the use of different techniques, and practice in developing the skills that come together to form the work of art. Spraul is going to take you deeper than just the syntax, semantics, and data structures of software to the heart of what makes a good programmer: the ability to creatively find and generate solutions to problems.

## [**Learn to Program**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520.Learn_to_Program) by Chris Pine. ##

To be honest, I have not looked through this book. It is, however, nearly universally recommended to people new to programming. The original tutorial is available online for free as well: [https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). LtP was featured on the great webcomic [Unshelved](http://www.unshelved.com/2014-7-25).

## [**The Pragmatic Programmer**](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas ##

This is the best modern treatise on the craft of programming. It represents the best of experiences programmers have come to appreciate during years of development. I read this book after years of practice, and found everything in it to ring true. \(The thought "I could have written this!" came up frequently.\) This book is not about any specific language or technology, but spans the gamut of software development. This is a must-have for practitioners.

## [**A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language) by Christopher Alexander. ##

You may be wondering why I've included a book on building construction. The answer is quite simple: the concepts in building towns and houses is nearly directly translatable to building software applications and systems. One part of being an excellent craftsperson is being able to apply abstract learning in different problem domains. If you are an expert in writing software, you are almost _never_ going to be solving problems only for other software developers. \(You can and should do so, but the client and users are generally non-programmers.\) Thus you're most likely going to be working in someone else's domain of expertise. Alexander's views on architecture apply to software architecture as well.

## [**Beautiful Code**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do) by Andy Oram and Greg Wilson. ##

A book with a purpose, that isn't a how to do, so much as a how to think. It's a collection of essays by various software developers on what they think makes code beautiful. In all, the following holds true:

1. First, make it correct.
2. Second, make it pretty.
3. Third, make it fast.

## **Programming Proverbs** by Henry F. Ledgard ##

This book, published in 1975, and a subsequent volume dedicated to the Pascal language published in 1979, were essential to me back when I was in university learning computer science. They're out of print now but sometimes they can be found on amazon marketplace or ebay.

## [**Systems Design Heuristics**](https://leanpub.com/systemdesignheuristics) - by the late, great Jerry Wienberg. ##

Jerry was a friend as well as a teacher. I miss him enormously. This book is full of his thoughts and writings on how one should do systems design. As the title implies, there are no rules, but there are some heuristics one can apply to the overall design and architecture of systems.
