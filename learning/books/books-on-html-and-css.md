# Books on HTML and CSS

## [HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) by Jon Duckett.

This book has been recommended by several people in the introductory web development courses I've been teaching and mentoring in. A very visual approach, using full-colour photographs to explain the two declarative languages.
