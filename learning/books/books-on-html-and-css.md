# Books on HTML and CSS

## [HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) by Jon Duckett.

This book has been recommended by several people in the introductory web development courses I've been teaching and mentoring in. A very visual approach, using full-colour photographs to explain the two declarative languages.
