# Web Sites

These are some of the web sites I like for learning.

This is just going to be a list of sites I've found or been pointed at for helping people learn to program. These are most definitely biased towards Ruby and Rails, as that is my current area of concentration, and generate the most requests that come to me.

## [**The Odin Project**](http://www.theodinproject.com/home) -- pulling together a curriculum from around the web, this is a curation site that gives order and structure to learning how to develop web applications.

## [**Code Kata**](http://codekata.com/) -- Dave Thomas's site that lists a great set of coding exercises. You can work these more than once, in fact that is what you do with kata.

## [**Exercism.IO**](http://exercism.io/) -- a site devoted to helping people learn and think deeply about writing excellent code. It has projects you implement and then get feedback on from others, and allows you to give feedback as well.

## [**CodeSchool**](https://www.codeschool.com/) -- learn from the "Comfort of your own browser". Codeschool has web casts, coding practices, challenges, and so on.

## [**CodeAcademy**](http://codeacademy.com) -- although I do not personally like the way one interacts with the web site, it does offer an gentle introduction to ruby, javascript, python and other subjects in an immediate feedback environment.

## [**Kahn Academy**](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs) -- learning to program with JavaScript \(if you are just starting out, JS is a fine language to learn. It's fairly ubiquitous in the online world.\). Their approach is teaching young folks, which might or might not appeal.

## [**RailsCasts**](http://railscasts.com/) -- another super awesome effort has been put together by Ryan Bates. Current production is on hiatus, so the $9/month fee for the full screen casts is being pro-rated, so you can buy in for $9 and there won't be further monthly charges until production starts up again.

## [**LearnCodeTheHardWay**](http://learncodethehardway.org/) -- provides online versions of books and tutorials for various languages

* [**Python**](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/),
* [**Ruby**](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/),
* [**C**](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/),
* [**SQL**](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/),
* [**Regular Expressions**](http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/) and more.

## [**Upcase, by Thoughtbot**](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase) -- not a bootcamp, a finishing school. Where to go to level-up.

## JavaScript specific

### [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com)

Highly prolific, always educational and informative, often fun and energizing. Kent C. Dodds is a great resource for the React and JS dev and test community. He is a key resource on testing principles and testing libraries.

## Ruby / Rails specific

### [**RubyTapas**](https://www.rubytapas.com/frequently-asked-questions/) -- Avdi Grimm is a fabulous Ruby and Rails mentor and guide, who puts out two very short screen casts a week \(tapas -- small plates\). These are really impeccably done, and I personally love listening to Avdi talk.

### [**RailsBridge**](http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/) -- a site devoted to helping people get up and running on learning Ruby on Rails, with emphasis on reaching out to women and LGBTQ folks. RailsBridge workshops are run around the world and the documents here can be used individually to help turn your computer into a development machine. What so often isn't addressed directly by very many of these sites and books is the ecosystem that one has to learn as well: a coding editor, the command line, rake, irb/pry, git, heroku if that is your choice for deployment \(which I do recommend for small beginner projects so you can show it off to your friends\); RailsBridge tutorials include these very important tools.

### [**RailsGirls Guides**](http://guides.railsgirls.com/) -- I haven't explored these in depth yet, I just got the site yesterday. However, I can see just from the list of guides these would be pretty great, just like the RailsBridge site above.

### [**Hartl's Rails Tutorial**](http://www.railstutorial.org/) -- the most often recommended site to learn how to create web applications in Rails, it goes beyond the Rails stack itself, teaching Ruby, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, user authentication and authorization, data modeling, and so on. While Michael sells the book, tutorials, and screen casts, the text of the tutorial online is free at [http://www.railstutorial.org/book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book). Considerable work has gone into this effort, however, so if you can afford to, please purchase at least the book.

### [**Ruby Koans**](http://www.rubykoans.com/) -- "koans" are an Eastern discipline tradition: small, repeated exercises to learn skills and build them into your muscles and memory, so you can use them without thinking consciously about them. In this sense, the ruby koans are small exercises intended to lead you on the way to learning ruby. I can't say if they're that successful, but some people definitely enjoy this progressive way of learning. The ruby koans definitely guide you in the way of test-first development, which is a beneficial practice for all to know.
