# on-demand learning

There are many, but there's only I truly recommend:

## [**Frontend Masters**](https://frontendmasters.com/)

FrontendMasters tackles intermediate and advanced topics in developing on the front end of web applications. Heavy into JavaScript, libraries, frameworks, techniques, and so on.

Based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota, they offer both live in-person and online courses, and they have recorded all the training sessions for on-demand viewing if you're a member. The quality of these sessions and the videos are extremely good \(these are not your twitch.tv live sessions of someone rambling about their code as they hack away\) All the courses I've taken and viewed are fantastic.

These are all recommended:

* [Four Semesters of Computer Science in 5 Hours](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science/) with [Brian Holt](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/)
* [Four Semesters of Computer Science in 5 Hours, Part 2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-2/) with Brian Holt
* [A Practical Guide to Algorithms with JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/) with [Bianca Gandolfo](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/bianca-gandolfo/)
* [Introduction to Data Structures for Interviews](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/data-structures-interviews/) with Bianca Gandolfo
