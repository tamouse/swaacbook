# Podcasts

I am not such a big fan of podcasts, but that has more to do with my personal learning style. Nevertheless, there are some great pocasts out there.

## [**Greater Than Code**](http://www.greaterthancode.com/)

Also known as `>Code`, this is a podcast that's more about people that practice software development and allied things, about management of such people, and making all our lives better.

## [**Frontend Happy Hour**](http://frontendhappyhour.com/)

A handful of front end developers, including Brian Holt, Jem Young, Ryan Burgess, Augustus Yuan, and Stacy London, joined by various guests. It's a fun podcast, each week with a special word or phrase that when uttered, everyone takes a drink.

## [**CodeNewbies**](http://www.codenewbie.org/)

started off as a twitter chat, and grew into a thing, CodeNewbies offers podcasts on topics that range far and wide. Recent topics have included Scrum/Agile methods, maintaining your mental health while programming, interviews with folks who have created significant web sites (Gina Trapani of LifeHacker!!), mobile, databases, single-page apps, you name it. One of the best aspects I can see directly is that this is a *very* open, diverse collaboration.
