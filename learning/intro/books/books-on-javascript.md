# Books on JavaScript

## [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2998152-javascript) by David Crockford.

JavaScript is a vast, sprawling language and ecosystem, and has been maligned for much poor code on the web. Crockford extracts out the parts that are really useful, giving the reader a better grounding. This book is the progenitor of many of the JavaScript frameworks that have come up the past few years, as well as CoffeeScript and other \*Script derivatives.

## [**You Don't Know JS series**](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) by [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify).

A _tour de force_ by one of the great teachers and evangelists of JavaScript, Kyle's "You Don't Know JS" series is a must-read collection of books. You can get the books in raw form on-line at the above address, and you can get the published e-books at your favourite vendor.

## [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke.

When I was more naive about JS, I wrote a bit of a negative review of this book. Subsequently, I've learned of it's true eloquence and meaning in giving a model of how to organize and implement modern JS. The subtitle "A modern introduction to programming" is still a bit misleading, perhaps, because you have to understand a fair bit of JavaScript _and_ programming to get the message, I feel. But that's just a quibble at this point. Read this before you strike out on creating a client-based JS application; you won't regret it.

## Test-Driven JavaScript Development by Christian Johansen \(Addison-Wesley Professional, September 2010, ISBN 9780321683915\)

The [ebook](http://www.informit.com/store/test-driven-javascript-development-9780321684042) for this title is ridiculously expensive. I read it via [safarionline](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-javascript-development/9780321684097/).

This book provides some great insights into testing JavaScript applications. Released in 2010, the things that are out of date are the specific tools used for testing, _however_, the concepts for writing tests and performing test-driven Javascript development are still very appropriate.

## [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix) by Reginald "raganwald" Braithwait

Using the metaphor of a coffee barista, Reg goes in depth on thinking about how JavaScript works; this is not a practical book from the standpoint of "tell me what code to write", but rather from the standpoint of knowing how JavaScript works inside so you can write better code yourself.
