# Books on Ruby

## [**Eloquent Ruby**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby) by Russ Olsen.

Olsen's approach in this book is to go far beyond just learning a programming language, but a way to learning the idioms and the "Ruby Way". Even if your chosen language is something other than Ruby, reading this book will give you an appreciation for how to delve into a language and get the most out of it.

## [**Confident Ruby**](http://www.confidentruby.com/) by Avdi Grimm.

More than any other book I've read on Ruby, "Confident Ruby" has affected my coding habits more than any other. If Ruby is about making programmers happy, _Confident Ruby_ is about making programming joyful, and not just in the immediate, but being able to look at code you've written in the future and recall the joy. _Confident Ruby_ seeks to combat software rot from the get-go.

## [**Well-Grounded Rubyist**](http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692) by David A. Black

Also known as the "Black Book" \(because of the author's name\), WGR is the successor to _Ruby for Rails_ by Black that provided me with the much-needed introduction to how to write Ruby code, with the idea of using it in Ruby for Rails. This book is a fabulous primer on the Ruby idioms and expressions that help make one a good Ruby programmer.

## [**Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby**](http://www.poodr.com/) by Sandi Metz

This book provides a deeply-needed introduction to object-oriented design, specifically targeted to the Ruby language. Ruby is one of the richest languages in which to express object-oriented patterns, but it is easy to fall of the OO wagon and start to get things messed up. Sandi provides the thinking tools necessary to decide how to structure your code for better maintainability, extensibility and testability. Comprehension and forward communication of the choices made during software design are crucial to programming, and Sandi is one of the very best at explaining things.
