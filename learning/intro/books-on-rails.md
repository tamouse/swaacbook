# Books on Rails

## [**Rails 4 in Action**](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/) by Ryan Bigg, Yehuda Katz, Steve Klabnik, and Rebecca Skinner.

A follow-on the highly successful Rails 3 in Action, R4iA has been completely rewritten, with new examples, case study, and all the great new features in Rails 4.

A great book for beginning Rails developers to start with, and for intermediate developers to step up their game.

## [**Practicing Rails**](https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/) by [Justin Weiss](http://www.justinweiss.com).

The first chapter alone \(free!\) is worth a download and very thorough read. Justin has provided one of the most effective strategies for learning just about _anything_ skill based, and it's especially effective for learning software skills. The focus of the book and the examples and such are obviously Rails, but the first chapter is applicable to anything.
