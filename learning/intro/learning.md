# Learning

Learning how to program can be a difficult journey. There is so much to learn! So much to remember! And then if you're going for your first job, all the interviews and white-board questions!

If you, like many, are trying to learn programming on your own, first off, GOOD ON YOU. Secondly, don't try to go it absolutely on your own. Find some learning buddies, start up a weekly study group, attend meetups in your area. If you live in a place where you're isolated from others learning this stuff, join online communities, follow some folks on Twitter, and so on. \(I won't say that is easy, just that it really helps.\)

One such online community that is full of beginners like yourself \(and a few more advanced folk\) is [Dev.To](https://dev.to/) where there are many articles, discussions, and you can ask your questions as well.

If you're in the Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota area, there are a lot of great meetups and opportunities. Two I'm affiliated with are:

* [Toast and Tech](http://toastand.tech/) which meets sporadically
* CodeJam which meets every Friday \(this is only really announced on the [Women Who Code Twin Cities slack team](https://wwcodetc.slack.com)\). There is also a [meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Twin-Cities/) you can join, and then ask to join the slack team.
