# Thoughts on Learning

Learning how to program can be a difficult journey. There is so much to learn! So much to remember! And then if you're going for your first job, all the interviews and white-board questions!

There are tons of self-directed \(auto-didactic\) sources out there; it can be hard to find ones that click for you , that fit your particular learning style, and actually help you to get better and better at this. I've been finding things around the 'net that can greatly help people new to programming, new to web development, new to Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and so on. But it's an ever-growing list, and it's still hard to pick out what's good for you.

So my big piece of advise on this:

> Learning is better with friends

If you, like many, are trying to learn programming on your own, first off, GOOD ON YOU. Secondly, don't try to go it absolutely on your own. Find some learning buddies, start up a weekly study group, attend meetups in your area. If you live in a place where you're isolated from others learning this stuff, join online communities, follow some folks on Twitter, and so on. \(I won't say that is easy, just that it really helps.\)

One such online community that is full of beginners like yourself \(and a few more advanced folk\) is [Dev.To](https://dev.to/) where there are many articles, discussions, and you can ask your questions as well.

If you're in the Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota area, there are a lot of great meetups and opportunities. Two \(out of many\) that I'm affiliated with are:

* [Toast and Tech](http://toastand.tech/) which meets sporadically \(this is one I run\)
* CodeJam which meets every Friday \(this is only really announced on the [Women Who Code Twin Cities slack team](https://wwcodetc.slack.com)\). There is also a [meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Twin-Cities/) you can join, and then ask to join the slack team.

## full disclosure

I'm actually attending a lot of meetups in my area, hackathons, and other cool stuff:

* [Women Who Code Twin cities](https://www.womenwhocode.com/twin-cities), mentioned above, is a local chapter of [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/), currently having monthly "choose your own adventure" hack nights, and often leads to interesting discussions and networking between the participants.
* [JavaScript MN](https://javascriptmn.com) is a JavaScript meetup with talks, presentations, and the occasional social event, geared towards JavaScript developers. I'm on the board for 2019.
* Code Switch, a hackathon that is part of the [Code For America](https://www.codeforamerica.org) [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-of-civic-hacking-2019), put on by [Techquity](https://www.techquity.mn/), [Software for Good](https://softwareforgood.com), and Open Twin Cities; the 2019 hackathon just finished. Looking forward to 2020 FIVE year anniversary.
* [Open Twin Cities](https://www.meetup.com/OpenTwinCities/) meets twice a month to focus on civic hacking throughout the year
* [Hack the Gap](https://www.hackthegap.com/) is a weekend hackathon that is open to women-identified and non-binary participants. The [fall 2019 hackathon](https://www.hackthegap.com/hackathons/october-2019) just completed.
* [React MPLS](https://www.meetup.com/React-Minneapolis-Meetup/) is another monthly meetup with talks and presentations focused on the React JS library / framework for JavaScript.
