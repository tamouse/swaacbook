description: The browser interactivity language that grew up to be a server language

I started writing JavaScript a long time ago when it first came out. I learned jQuery along the way. A few years ago, I started attending courses at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) taking all sorts of courses on different libraries, frameworks, and so on.

I learned a bit of Angular, Vue, and other stuff.

I learned a fair bit of React.

Then I got a job as a frontend developer, transitioning from my traditional role as ruby and rails API developer.

This is stuff I've learned. Hope it helps \(you and future me\).
