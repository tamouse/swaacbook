In October 2018, I gave a talk / tutorial on [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/basics/introduction/), an environment for developing visual components, and how I'm using it in developing React components at work, for [React Minneapolis meetup](https://twitter.com/ReactMpls).

The talk was recorded, and video is up at [yahoo](https://youtu.be/9B-IB2U3qSI).
