# Link: Dan Abramov: A Complete Guide to useEffect

Here's a link to Dan Abramov's [Overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/) article on the often confusing but highly useful `useEffect` hook to replace lifecycle methods in React components.

> You wrote a few components with [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Maybe even a small app. You’re mostly satisfied. You’re comfortable with the API and picked up a few tricks along the way. You even made some [custom Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) to extract repetitive logic \(300 lines gone!\) and showed it off to your colleagues. “Great job”, they said.

> But sometimes when you `useEffect`, the pieces don’t quite fit together. You have a nagging feeling that you’re missing something. It seems similar to class lifecycles… but is it really? You find yourself asking questions like:
>
> * 🤔 How do I replicate `componentDidMount` with `useEffect`?
> * 🤔 How do I correctly fetch data inside `useEffect`? What is `[]`?
> * 🤔 Do I need to specify functions as effect dependencies or not?
> * 🤔 Why do I sometimes get an infinite refetching loop?
> * 🤔 Why do I sometimes get an old state or prop value inside my effect?
