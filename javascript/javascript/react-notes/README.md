# React notes

In 2018, React turned 5 years old, and the current version \(16.9 as of August 2019\) is so vastly different from the original. As a framework, it continues to change at an astounding velocity, which makes it hard to write something without having to turn around and update most everything already written.

It is a **fun** framework, though, and when you get the rhythm of writing React, it can just flow along.
