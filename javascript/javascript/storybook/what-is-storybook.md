# What is Storybook?

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is a tool to provide a mean to display and interact with individual components without requiring them to be tucked into a complete running app. This is my way to see what I'm creating when writing React components.

Storybook works with many other frameworks as well as POJS.
