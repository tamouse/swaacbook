# Design is Engineering, Engineering is Design

I took a seminar back when I was in Uni, called "Design is Engineering, Engineering is Design" and lots of things lately have been reminding me of that.

There's a notion in the world of making web sites that there are these two camps:

* Design, which refers here specifically to visual or graphic design, user interface, look and feel, and user experience, and
* Development, which refers to coding, testing, deploying, and maintaining the web site

These camps seem separated by very different skill and knowledge sets, talents and abilities, and epistemologies.

What is often said that the person that speak in both of these worlds is a unicorn, i.e., an imaginary beast that doesn't exist.

I have a few friends that give a lot of conference talks trying to break down that thought, that, in fact, designers and developers can, and even should, talk to each other with understanding on both sides.

I just finished a book, [Code Simplicity: The Fundamentals of Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18912511-code-simplicity), by [Max Kanat-Alexander](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5389838.Max_Kanat_Alexander), which touched on the concept of design, but not the visual or graphic sort of design, but the design of the software that is being developed.

This brought back my thoughts on the class, which discussed things like how bridges and buildings are designed, in order to not fall down.

{% hint style="info" %}
Anyone can build a bridge that doesn't fall down, but only an engineer can build a bridge that just barely doesn't fall down.
{% endhint %}

The joke isn't that engineers never build a bridge that doesn't fall down, it's that the sorts of things that are taught for engineering, and this only sometimes includes software development, are the things that make good bridges that don't fall down when they study them well enough.

I think visual design does this, too. 

* anyone can put information onto a page, but only a designer can put information onto a page that is appealing and helpful to understand that information.
* anyone can throw links onto a web site, but only a UX designer can make navigation make sense for the intended user

So where the course and Max's book are intended to direct engineering types to consider the act of design, i.e, the thoughtful research and planning of what to implement, given the broader context of what is needed by users and what already exists.

I'm not a visual designer so I really don't know this, but experience of listening to visual designers talk leads me to the conclusion that there is that same step of thoughtful research and planning that happens before commiting to a specific layout, set of affordances, and the user experience of a web site.
