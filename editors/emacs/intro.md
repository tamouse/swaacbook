# Introduction to notes on Emacs

I started using Emacs waaaa--aaa0-aay back in 1984, when I moved from a proprietary system editor to my first Unix system. I fell in love with it quickly when I learned I could configure and extend it with Lisp, the 3rd language I ever learned in programming, and the one I was most in love with.

It's been a hella journey; I've tried lots and lots of different editors, even sticking with them for a while, but I always came back to Emacs.
