So that's a really old joke, and I'd thought I'd written something about it long ago.

There's a funny comic that goes around from time to time \(I'd thought it was one of Randall Monroe's, but it's not\): [https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/](https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/)

It's often sourced from [this blog entry](http://commadot.com/wtf-per-minute/) with a computer-drawn version, but I rather like the original.
