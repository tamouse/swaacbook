The Electronic Freedom Foundation \([EFF](https://www.eff.org/)\) is working to [encrypt the web](https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web), converting all web sites from HTTP to HTTPS. [Baratunde Thurston](http://baratunde.com/) narrates the [video](https://youtu.be/PdnpNJZVUE0) explaining web encryption to the masses.

You may notice my sites don’t use HTTPS. The only reason is I’ve not gotten around to implementing it yet.

I’ve used it on projects, and it’s pretty simple to set up. Look for a future post, probably.
