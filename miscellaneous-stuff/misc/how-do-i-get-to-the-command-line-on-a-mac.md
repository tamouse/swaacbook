## From Finder

1.  Open a Finder window.

2.  Go to the `Applications` folder (this could be in the side bar of the Finder window or you should be able to press Shift-Command-A unless you've previously modified your keyboard shortcuts.)

3.  Scroll down to the `Utilites` folder and double click it to open it.

4.  Scroll down until to find the `Terminal` application, and double click it to open it.

5.  When it opens, the icon for `Terminal` will appear in the Dock. Right-click the icon, and select the "Keep in Doc" option.

Now you can easily open the Terminal just by clicking on the icon in the Dock when you want one.

## From Spotlight

1.  Press Command-Spacebar to open the Spotlight search dialog.

2.  Type "ter" &#x2013; this should be enough to highlight the `Terminal` application.

3.  Press the Return key and `Terminal` will start.

Follow step 5 in the previous section to keep Terminal in your Dock.
