As some of you following know, I've led this thing on Tuesday nights called "Toast & Tech" for about 3 years [starting in the Autumn of 2015], nominally under the organization at .@GDImpls, the Minneapolis chapter of .@girldevelopit.

I have left that organization, but I want to leave behind something for those involved in T&T, and for those looking to make a space for learning that it inclusive

## The Tenets of Toast and Tech:

-   make **everyone** welcome, enthusiastically
-   make **all** questions welcome, enthusiastically
-   everyone is learning, everyone is teaching
-   there is no single path, there are as many paths as people attending, as many paths as needed
-   you don't need a project or tech work to attend, just come
-   you don't need any experience to attend, just come
-   support everyone who shows up
-   Make it safe to learn, safe to ask questions, safe to show up.

Possibly the **most** important tenet of all: #ToastAndTech can happen **anywhere**, run by **anyone**; all it takes is letting folks know about it, and showing up to hold the space.
