Recently I took a couple classes from [FrontendMasters](http://www.frontendmasters.com) lead by [Kyle Simpson](http://getify.me/) on JavaScript Basics to Building, and JavaScript Types, Coercion, and Sharing.

These are images of the notes I took:

{% for image in page.gallery.images %} <%7B%7B%20image%20%7C%20prepend:%20page.gallery.path%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.s3path%20%7D%7D>
