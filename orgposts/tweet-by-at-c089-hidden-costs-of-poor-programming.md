Back in the day, at the *old* HP (not this one, the one that still was named after the founders, Bill and Dave), we talked quite a bit about "Cost of Quality" &#x2013; which was entirely directed at the costs of *poor* quality code released into the field. The direct costs went up by one or two orders of magnitude each step along the lifecycle. The cost of fixing a bug post-release were something like 10 thousand times the cost of fixing it in development.
