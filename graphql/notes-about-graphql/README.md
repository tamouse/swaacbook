# Notes about GraphQL

## What is the GraphQL?

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
