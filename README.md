# Intro to SWAAC

> My devblog takes another turn. How will this one turn out?

Over the years, I've been keeping notes and writing things down about stuff I've learned, stuff I want to share, and so on. In the never-ending quest to learn new things, I've also re-organized and repurposed this collection so many times.

Going to give this a go, and see how it works.
